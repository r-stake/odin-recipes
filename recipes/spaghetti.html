        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <ul class="columns-ul">
                <li>Your favorite brand of spaghetti</li>
                <li>Two cans of chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>Fresh basil</li>
                <li>Oregano</li>
                <li>A single medium onion</li>
                <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Tomato pasta</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a pot of water over high heat until it starts boiling. Add some spaghetti noodles and reduce the heat to medium. Keep the pot lid partly closed, so that it doesn't spill over. Keep them boiling for about 20-30 minutes. Occasionally taste the noodles to see if they're done.</li>
            <li>While spaghetti are boiling, peel the onion and garlic, chop them up neatly. Pour some olive oil in to the frying pan, put the onions in first and heat them up over medium heat while stirring occasionally. After the onions have turned yellow, add the garlic and heat them for another minute.</li>
            <li>Open the cans of chopped tomatoes and pour them in to the frying pan, along with the tomato pasta. Don't add too much pasta, or the sauce will be too thick. Dilute with water if that happens.</li>
            <li>Add seasoning to the sauce: the fresh basil, oregano, some salt for taste. Turn the heat down to low and keep stirring the sauce. After about 5 minutes you can put the lid on and leave it for 10-15 minutes. Remove the lid and stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>When the spaghetti are done, carefully pour out the water and place as much sauce as you want in to the pot. Mix it up nicely and serve. If you want, you can add some shredded cheese on top, it will melt nicely from the heat. Bon appetit.</li>
        </ol>
