TOP Project: Recipes
Project started: 2023.04.23 17:30.
The goal of the project is to apply all the HTML knowledge learned so far by building a basic recipes website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
In it's first iteration, it will not have any CSS style elements in it and it will get revised and updated later in the curriculum.
