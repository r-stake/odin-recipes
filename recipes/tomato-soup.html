        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Two cans of chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>Garlic (as much as you like)</li>
            <li>A single medium sized onion</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>An egg</li>
            <li>Three medium potatoes</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Tabasco or any other hot sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>Dried or fresh bay leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up the pot you'll be using for soup and add the bay leaves. Once the water starts boiling, turn down the heat and keep the leaves in for 30-60 minutes. The longer the richer the flavor. Water should turn a nice brownish color from the leaves. Once done, get the leaves out - slotted spoon will make your life a lot easier..</li>
            <li>While the water is soaking in the bay leaves, peel and chop the onion, garlic, basil leaves. Peel your potatoes and boil them in how water. You'll know they're done when you poke them with a knife and they easily slide off.</li>
            <li>Put some olive oil in the pan and heat up those chopped onions. After a couple of minutes, when they turn yellow, pour in the garlic. Blend the potatoes in a blender and pour it in a pot with bay leaf water. If you want, you can blend the cooked garlic and onions as well, or just pour them in to the pot as is.</li>
            <li>Open the canned tomatoes and pour them in to the soup pot. If you're substituting canned tomatoes for fresh, you'll need to put them in hot boiling water for one minute and then peel the skin after cooling then in a bowl of cold water. If you're tomatoes aren't chopped, you'll need to crush them and if you can, blend them using a blender. You can blend all of them, or just some, depends how smooth you like your soup.</li>
            <li>Heat up the pot over medium heat. Add black pepper and the hot sauce if you like. Your ingredients should have enough salt in them already so you don't need to add any more, unless you really like it salty then add according to your taste.</li>
            <li>Boil some some water in a pot and add an egg in it. Make sure the egg has warmed up to room temperature before you boil it so that it doesn't crack in the pot. I recommend that the egg remains runny, so don't overcook it. Make sure it doesn't boil longer than 7 minutes. After that, put it in some cold water.</li>
            <li>Once the soup boils, turn down the heat to minimum and keep it like that for 15-20 minutes. After that, turn off the heat and add the chopped basil.</li>
            <li>Peel the egg and slice it in half.</li>
            <li>Pour the soup in a bowl and gently set the egg in it. If the soup is thick enough it should float nicely.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favorite piece of bread. Bon appetit. </li>
        </ol>
