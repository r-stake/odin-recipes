                <li>Loaf of black bread</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Mayonnaise</li>

        <h3 class="text-left-aligned">Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the bread in to pieces of preferred shape and size. Most commonly the bread is sliced in to rectangular 2 cm long pieces, this shape make it easy to dip the fried bread stick in to the sauce, but you'll have more pieces to manage in the frying pan. Ultimately it comes down to a combination of personal preference and patience.</li>
            <li>Pour enough vegetable oil in to the frying pan to cover the whole surface. Heat it up over medium heat and place the sliced pieces of bread in to the pan.</li>
            <li>After the bread starts sizzling, you can turn down the heat a little, but don't set it to low yet.</li>
            <li>After about a minute of sizzling, you can start turning the pieces over on the other side. Fry the bread on both sides till it starts to become crisp and brittle. Be sure to flip them over ofter to check if they haven't started burning. Adjust the heat accordingly, but don't over do it, better to take longer than ruin the batch.</li>
            <li>Place some paper towels on a plate or a bowl, remove the bread from hit and place it on the paper towels to drain the excess oil.</li>
            <li>Allow the bread to cool and then rub a clove of garlic on both sides of each piece. Sprinkle a little salt and you're done.</li>
            <li>Put a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise in a small bowl, add some grated cheese, put it in the microwave oven and heat it until the cheese melts.</li>
            <li>Dip the bread stick in to the cheese and mayo sauce. Bon appetit.</li>
